# Aseprite - xcolor
An external color picking script for Aseprite using [xcolor](https://github.com/Soft/xcolor) by Soft. Allows you to pick colors from outside of the Aseprite application. Currently only tested on Linux.

## Installation
* Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/steven-kraft/aseprite-xcolor/releases) page
* Extract the files to your Aseprite scripts folder (~/.config/aseprite/scripts/aseprite-xcolor/)
* Run Aseprite as root (Aseprite won't execute external files otherwise)

## How to Use
* Make sure to launch Aseprite as root
* Go to File -> Scripts -> aseprite-xcolor -> aseprite-xcolor
* This should launch xcolor and allow you to pick any color on the screen
